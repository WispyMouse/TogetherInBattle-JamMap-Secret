	Custom voice acting for the campaign should be stored in this folder.
	
	All VA audio must be saved as .ogg files, easily accomplished
	by recording them using the free, open-source audio recording and editing
	program Audacity (https://www.audacityteam.org/).
	
		&gt; Within a dialogue tree, these files can be played using the PlayDialogue
		  script action.
	
		&gt; Within cutscene narration, they can be played using the special character
		  -VO:Custom/X- (where 'X' is the file name of the voice-over to be used).
		  For example--to play a voice-over file named Intro.ogg, your narration might
		  look something like this:
		  
		  I had never understood why Father didn't talk about the war...until the
		  night of Insidia's betrayal. Then, suddenly, it made a kind of terrible sense. -VO:Custom/Intro-
