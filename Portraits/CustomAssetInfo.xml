	Custom static portraits can be saved in subfolders within this folder, then selected as custom portraits for your campaign's characters.
	
	These portraits must be saved as PNG files. (Recommended dimensions: 512 x 512, 1024 x 1024, or something similar. If the width and height are not
	equal, your portrait may appear distorted or fail to load in the correct location!)
	
	Unlike the game's dynamic portraits, static portraits like these are just a single layer with all features fully baked in.
	This means that they will not support changing palette, facial expressions, clothing, or other aspects on the fly. To change a static portrait's
	expression, clothing, or other features, a suitable variant of the portrait will need to exist in a separate image; that variant must then be loaded 
	at runtime using the AddPortrait script action.
	
	You can add a character's custom portrait in dialogue as normal by supplying the character's name in AddPortrait; however, to add
	a variant not assigned as a character's default portrait, use the shortcut 'Custom:' to tell the game to look inside the Portraits folder.
	Follow this with the subfolder name, a backslash, and finally the filename of the variant portrait (including its .png file extension).
	
	FOR EXAMPLE: suppose you have a folder called Hero inside your campaign's Portraits folder containing portrait images for the character Hero.
	Suppose to wanted to load the variant portrait image HeroMad.png from that folder as a dialogue portrait. You would use the following script action:   
	
	AddPortrait   
	Custom:Hero\HeroMad.png
