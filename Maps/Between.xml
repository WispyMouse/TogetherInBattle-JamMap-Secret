		<Branch num="1" name="">Jerald Swiftrig/BOXED: Mm, yes. By my calculations (and by the frostbite forming around my finger tips) this does seem sort of... information removing device. It allows an [i]attuned[/i] user to [i]remove heat[/i], in to this lantern. Fascinating. It must work off of uh... [Heshe looks carefully at the lantern] Weird science magic. Yes.

		<Branch num="0" name="">Tillie Starwright/BOXED: And so we returned to the town, and became the new source of frost powers in the community. We made up some glamorous lie about our emergent power. A simple, familiar narrative; we generously give out our wondrous frost, and keep the details to ourselves.
