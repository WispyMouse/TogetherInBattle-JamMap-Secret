		<Branch num="0" name="">Tillie Starwright/Sooth had a pretty good time of it. Got through a saga of lying without telling a single truth. That's pretty impressive, I think. I asked how he was doing, and he said "I could be better". I wonder how to interpret that coming from the mouth of a casual liar?

		<Branch num="3" name="">Tillie Starwright/Jerald submitted some detailed research papers about the lantern for publication in the colleges. Most of them came back with criticism that they were "incomprehensible" and "mostly made up words". Now he won't stop bragging about how he got a [i]response[/i] from top colleges... leaving out unnecessary details about the contents of those responses.
