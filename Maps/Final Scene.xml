		<Branch num="0" name="">Tillie Starwright/BOXED: Sooth had a pretty good time of it. Got through a saga of lying without telling a single truth. That's pretty impressive, I think. I asked how he was doing, and he said "I could be better". I wonder how to interpret that coming from the mouth of a casual liar?

		<Branch num="2" name="">Tillie Starwright/BOXED: Depending on Bront's mood, we either fought an ice dragon or a vile cult, and we [i]rescued[/i] the lantern from evil. Oh, and there are usually giants and ghouls involved. If people believe in a fraction of his stories, he'll be a figure of folk tales in the future.

		<Branch num="3" name="">Tillie Starwright/BOXED: Jerald submitted some detailed research papers about the lantern for publication in the colleges. Most of them came back with criticism that they were "incomprehensible" and "mostly made up words". Now he won't stop bragging about how he got a [i]response[/i] from top colleges... leaving out unnecessary details about the contents of those responses.

		<Branch num="4" name="">Tillie Starwright/BOXED: Rustler still argues she's special. Sure [i]anyone[/i] could easily use frost powers with the lantern, but she was able to use it [i]especially easily[/i]. The town lets her hold the lantern sometimes when she asks. People around here care about her more than she reckons, you know?

		<Branch num="5" name="">Tillie Starwright/BOXED: Laina was really relieved when we stopped lying about our powers. I think she went on to immediately worry about "not telling the truth soon enough", like there's some kind of limitation on how long a good lie is allowed to last. She self-imposed a year of community service.
